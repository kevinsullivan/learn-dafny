    /* LITERAL EXPRESSIONS

    A literal expression is a boolean literal (true or false), a null object reference (null), an unsigned integer (e.g., 3) or real (e.g., 3.0) literal, a character (e.g., 'a') or string literal (e.g., "abc"), or “this” which denote the current object in the context of an instance method or function. We have not yet seen objects or talked about instance methods or functions.

    the Boolean expression was true, otherwise the second one.

    right side of an update/assignment statement. There is also an
    if *statement*.

    Conjunction and disjuction are associative. This means that

    to (b1 && (b2 && b3)), and the same for ||. 
    
    These operators are also "short circuiting" ( left to right). That is, their second argument is evaluated only if evaluating  the first operand does not by itself determine the value of the 
    expression. (From RefMan.)

    Here's an example where short circuit evaluation matters. It
    prevents the evaluation of an undefined expressions after &&.

    /* LET

    A let expression allows binding of intermediate values to identifiers for use in an expression. The start of the let expression is signaled by the var keyword. They look like local variable declarations except the scope of the variable only extends to following expression. Adapted from RefMan.
    
    Here's an example (see the following code).

    First x+x is computed and bound to sum, the result
    of the overall expression on the right hand side of
    the update/assignment statement is then the value of 
    "sum * sum" given this binding. The binding does not
    persist past the evaluation of the "let" expression.
    The expression is called a "let" expression because
    in many other languages, you'd use a let keyword to
    write this: let sum = x + x in sum * sum. Dafny just
    uses a slightly different syntax.
