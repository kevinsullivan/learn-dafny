            Start by noting that we can't do a simple 
            "lookup" using the birthday map, as it maps
            in the wrong direction. It returns dates given 
            names, not names given dates. To find  names 
            with a given birthday, we have to do a search. 
            That is, we'll have to look at each name in 
            turn look up its corresponding birthday, and 
            add it to a set of results if the birthday 
            for that name match with the given birthday.

            Our algorithmic strategy will be to iterate over
            the elements of the "known" set. We will initialize
            a set, "left", to be "known". We use "left" as a 
            name, as the value of this set will represent the
            subset of names that are "left" to be checked. On
            each executio of the while loop body, if the name
            currently being checked has the given birthday
            we add that name to an initally empty result set, 
            "acc", and iterate, with the name just checked
            now removed from the set that is "left" to be
            checked. The loop is done when there is no more
            work "left" to do. 

            For Dafny to verify that our program satisfies
            its specification, it needs a loop invariant.
            Figuring out what the loop invariant should be
            is usually the most "interesting" part of getting
            loops right.

            Our invariant is that, no matter how many times
            the loop body has executed, the set of names with 
            birthdays today (the result we seek) is the set 
            of names that we've already selected as having a 
            birthday today (the result of the work already
            done, represented in the value of "acc") combined 
            with the set of names with birthdays today that
            remain in the set that is still "left" to be
            checked. 
            
            Given this invariant, and using just a little bit
            of logical reasoning, it's clear that when the 
            the loop is finished, there will be no work left, 
            and so all of the names with birthdays today will
            *have to be* in the "acc" set. The loop *forces*
            the answer that we seek to end up in "acc". 

            To pronounce the loop invariant in English, we'd
            say, "no matter how many times the loop body runs
            (that's the meaning of "invariant") the set of 
            names that are known AND with birthdays today" is
            the union of two sets: the subset of names that
            are "left" to be checked AND that have birthdays
            today, and the set of names that we have already
            found (in the set of known names) with birthdays 
            today.

        This class has one constructor. In Dafny, 
        a constructor called "constructor" with no
        arguments is called implicitly when one
        uses "new" to create a class instance with
        no explicitly constructor call. 

        The specification of this constructor is
        critically important. It requires that 
        a fresh new object of this type satisfy
        the Init predicate, and thereby also 
        satisfy the "representation invariant."

        Now here's the intelelctual magic trick:
        if we know that any new object satisfies 
        the representation invariant, and that 
        every method execution *preserves* the
        invariant, then we can conclude by way
        of "inductive reasoning" that the class,
        or representation, invariant must always
        hold.

        If the programming langauges prevents
        direct access to state variables (here
        "known" and "birthday") then one can be
        sure that there's *no way* to violate 
        the "integrity" of the representation.
        This idea is absolutely fundamental in
        program design: if you're careful and
        your programming languages provides
        the right mechanisms, then you can be
        absolutely certain that "abstractions"
        cannot be violated no matter what you
        do to an object.
