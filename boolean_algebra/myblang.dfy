    VARIABLES: We want to define a language of Boolean expressions
    that includes Boolean variables, not just literals. So beyond
    being able to represent expressions such as (true && false), in
    our little language as (bAnd(bTrue,bFalse)), we also want to be
    able to write expressions such as (P && Q), or in our language
    as (bAnd(bVar(P),bVar(Q))). To this end, we need to define a new
    type, the values of which are "variables", and then we need a 
    way to incorporate *variable expressions* into the syntax of our
    language. 

    Here's a datatype with a single constructor, V, taking one nat
    as an argument. Terms such as V(0), V(1), and V(2) are thus of
    type "variable". These will be our variables.

            expression. However, our original code continues to call
            bEval (recursively) with only one parameter. Clearly you
            must a provide a second parameter to each recursive call.
            The question is, in what environment should you evaluate
            the subexpressions! THINK HARD. You will eventually see
            the light. Don't give up.
