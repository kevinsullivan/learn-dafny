/*
As in many programming languages, a module has a name
and defines a namespace. Here the module name will be
"functions." Within the module constructs are defined
and named. The first construct defined in this module
is named "id_int". Within the scope of a module, names
can be used directly. From outside a module, constructs
defined within the module can generally be accessed, 
but the module name must be prepended to the construct
name. From outside of this "functions" module, one can
refer to the "id_int" function as "functions.int_id", 
for example.

    /*
    In mathematics, a function is understood as a
    single-valued binary relation. By the term,
    binary relation, we mean a set of ordered pairs.
    By single-valued we mean that no two pairs have
    the same first value but different second values.
    The binary relation that associates each natural
    number (non-negative integer) with its square,
    e.g., (2,4), (3, 9), (4, 16), etc.) is also a
    function because it is single-valued. However,
    the square root function that associates each
    non-negative real number with its real-valued
    square roots is not a function because it is not
    single valued. For example it contains both the
    pair (4,2) and (4, -2). 
    
    Note, however, that we can consider variants of
    the square root relation that are functions. 
    First, we could consider the "non-negative square 
    root function", that associates each non-negative
    real number with its non-negative square root, of
    which there is only one. Alternatively, we could 
    consider the function that associates to each 
    non-negative real number the single *set* of
    its square roots. In this relation, we would have
    such ordered pairs as (4, {2, -2}),, for example.

    An "identity function" for values of type nat.
    Returns whatever int value you pass to it. Note:
    the body of a pure function is not sequential 
    code operating on a memory, code but simply an 
    expression that computes a desired return value. 
    
    The "function method" declaration indicates two
    things. First, the code will be written in a pure
    functional style. Second, the code can be called
    from imperative code. Dafny compiles "function 
    methods" into executable code. Code declared to
    be just a "function" in Dafny can be used in pre-
    and post-conditions and in other specifications,
    and so can be involved in verification, but such
    functions are not compiled to executable code.

     defined for all natural numbers, from 0 up; and you

     A better definition is a recursive definition. It has

     any larger number, n, is n times the factorial of the
     next smaller number, n-1. When the next smaller number
     is zero, the result is 1 and the product is then the
