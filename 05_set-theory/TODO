        * DIRECTED SET

        "In mathematics, a directed set (or a directed preorder or a filtered set) is a nonempty set A together with a reflexive and transitive binary relation ≤ (that is, a preorder), with the additional property that every pair of elements has an upper bound.[1] In other words, for any a and b in A there must exist c in A with a ≤ c and b ≤ c." 
        
        "A downward/upward directed set is defined analogously,
        meaning when every pair of elements is bounded below/above."

        * WELL-QUASI-ORDERING

        "A well-quasi-ordering on a set {\displaystyle 
        X} X is a quasi-ordering (i.e., a reflexive, 
        transitive binary relation) such that any 
        infinite sequence of elements {\displaystyle 
        x_{0}} x_{0}, {\displaystyle x_{1}} x_{1}, 
        {\displaystyle x_{2}} x_{2}, … from {\displaystyle 
        X} X contains an increasing pair {\displaystyle 
        x_{i}} x_{i}≤ {\displaystyle x_{j}} x_{j} with 
        {\displaystyle i} i< {\displaystyle j} j. The 
        set {\displaystyle X} X is said to be 
        well-quasi-ordered, or shortly wqo."

        NB: The use of "quasi-order" in the preceding
        paragraph is NOT consistent with the use that
        we have formalized as a propery, above. Rather,
        the property indicated here (a reflexive and
        transitive relation) is what we've called a
        preorder.

        
        Among other ways of defining wqo's, one is to 
        say that they are quasi-orderings which do not 
        contain infinite strictly decreasing sequences 
        (of the form {\displaystyle x_{0}} x_{0}> 
        {\displaystyle x_{1}} x_{1}> {\displaystyle 
        x_{2}} x_{2}>…) nor infinite sequences of 
        pairwise incomparable elements. Hence a 
        quasi-order (X,≤) is wqo if and only if 
        (X,<) is well-founded and has no infinite 
        antichains.
