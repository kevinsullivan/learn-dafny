/*
    This module is a helper module for our
    propositional logic syntax module. This
    module provides functions for dealing
    with variable objects and variable terms
    in our logic.
    
    In the usual definition of propositional
    logic, an "interpretation" is a mapping
    from a subset of terms, namey variable
    terms, to corresponding Boolean values.
    
    It's easier to define and manage this
    mapping when "variables" are of their
    own type, as is the case here, rather
    than being a subset of terms of another
    type (namely prop, i.e., logical terms).
    
    Thus in our design we have a separate 
    propVar type, and instance of which is
    required to create a variable *term* in
    our logic.
