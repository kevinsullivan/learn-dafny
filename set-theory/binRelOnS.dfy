This class provides an abstraction of a polymorphic
finite binary relation over a set, S, of elements 
of an equality-supporting type, T. In mathematical
terminology, this is an endorelation, a homogeneous
relation or just a set with one of several kinds of
relations (e.g., an ordered set if the relation is
a total order).

        A canonical example of a partial order is the 
        "subset-of" relation on the powerset of a given
        set. It's reflexive as every set is a subset of

        subset of T and T is a subset of S then T=S.

        other, so they are not "comparable:" There is 
        no pair of these two sets, in either order, in
        the "subset-of" relation.

        for every x in S there is *SOME* y to which it is 
        related (or mapped, as we say). We thus provide 
        isTotalFunction and isPartialFunction predicates 
        (with Function in the names) to capture this idea.
        
        By contrast, a binary relation (more generally) 
        is said to be total, or "complete", if for *any* 
        pair of values, x and y in S, either (or both) 
        of (x, y) or (y, x) is in the relation.

        A simple example of a total relation is the less
        than or equals relation on integers. Given any 
        two integers, x and y, it is always the case that
        either x <= y or y <= x, or both if they're equal.

        Anoather example of a total binary relation
        is what economists call a preference relation. A
        preference relation is a mathematical model of 
        a consumer's preferences. It represents the idea
        that given *any* two items, or outcomes, x and y,
        one will always find one of them to be "at least 
        as good as" the other. These ideas belong to the 
        branch of economics called "utility theory." 

        The broader point of this brief diversion into 
        the field of economics is to make it clear that
        what seem like very abstract concepts (here the
        property of a binary relation being complete or
        not) have deep importance in the real world: in
        CS as well as in many other fields.

        We can now formalize the property of being total.
        A binary relation, R, on a set, S, is said to be 
        "complete," "total" or to have the "comparability" 
        property if *any* two elements, x and y in S, are 
        related one way or the other by R, i.e., at least 
        one of (x, y) and (y, x) is in R.

        Weak ordering

        "There are several common ways of formalizing weak orderings, 
        that are different from each other but cryptomorphic 
        (interconvertable with no loss of information): they may be 
        axiomatized as strict weak orderings (partially ordered sets 
        in which incomparability is a transitive relation), as total 
        preorders (transitive binary relations in which at least one 
        of the two possible relations exists between every pair of 
        elements), or as ordered partitions (partitions of the 
        elements into disjoint subsets, together with a total order 
        on the subsets)....
        
        ... weak orders have applications in utility theory. In 
        linear programming and other types of combinatorial 
        optimization problem, the prioritization of solutions or 
        of bases is often given by a weak order, determined by a 
        real-valued objective function; the phenomenon of ties 
        in these orderings is called "degeneracy", and several 
        types of tie-breaking rule have been used to refine this 
        weak ordering into a total ordering in order to prevent 
        problems caused by degeneracy.

        Weak orders have also been used in computer science, in 
        partition refinement based algorithms for lexicographic 
        breadth-first search and lexicographic topological ordering. 
        In these algorithms, a weak ordering on the vertices of 
        a graph (represented as a family of sets that partition 
        the vertices, together with a doubly linked list providing 
        a total order on the sets) is gradually refined over the 
        course of the algorithm, eventually producing a total 
        ordering that is the output of the algorithm.

        In the Standard (Template) Library for the C++ programming 
        language, the set and multiset data types sort their input 
        by a comparison function that is specified at the time of 
        template instantiation, and that is assumed to implement 
        a strict weak ordering." --Wikipedia

        A strict weak ordering is a strict partial order in which the relation "neither a R b nor b R a" is transitive. That is, for
        all x, y, z in S, if neither x R y nor y R x holds, and if neither y R z nor z R y holds, then neither x R z nor z R x holds.

        In the C++ Standard Template Library (STL), if you want to use
        a standard sort routine or map data structure you have to define 
        an overloaded < operator; and it has to imlpement a strict weak
        ordering relation.

        From StackOverflow:

        This notion, which sounds somewhat like an oxymoron, is not very commonly used in mathematics, but it is in programming. The "strict" just means it is the irreflexive form "<" of the comparison rather than the reflexive "≤". The "weak" means that the absence of both a<b and b<a do not imply that a=b. However as explained here, the relation that neither a<b nor b<a holds is required to be an equivalence relation. The strict weak ordering then induces a (strict) total ordering on the equivalence classes for this equivalence relation.

        This notion is typically used for relations that are in basically total orderings, but defined using only partial information about the identity of items. For instance if a<b between persons means that a has a name that (strictly) precedes the name of b alphabetically, then this defines a strict weak order, since different persons may have identical names; the relation of having identical names is an equivalence relation.

        One can easily show that for a strict weak ordering "<", the relation a≮b is (reflexive and) transitive, so it is a pre-order,and the associated equivalence relation is the same as the one associated above to the strict weak ordering. In fact "a≮b" is a total pre-order which induces the same total ordering (or maybe it is better to say the opposite ordering, in view of the negation) on its equivalence classes as the strict weak ordering does. I think I just explained that the notions of strict weak ordering and total pre-order are equivalent. The WP article also does a reasonable job explaining this.

        Marc van Leeuwen:
        If you are comparing strings, then you would often just define a total ordering (which is a special case of a strict weak ordering) like lexicographic ordering. However, it could be that you want to ignore upper case/lower case distinctions, which would make it into a true weak ordering (strings differing only by case distinctions would then form an equivalence class).

        As an example, the the less than relation over the
